        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Adobo is one of the most popular dishes from the Philippines. This dish can be made with different proteins like pork and beef, but this recipe will focus on a chicken variation.</p>
        <p>The key to this recipe is finding the right balance of soy sauce, vinegar, black pepper, and sugar where each ingredient blends together in a flavorful glaze.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For Chicken and Marinade:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5-2 lb chicken thighs (about 6), boneless and skinless</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1/3 cup soy sauce, ordinary all-purpose or light (not dark soy sauce)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup + 2 tbsp white vinegar</li>
            <li>4 bay leaves (fresh) or 3 dried</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Cooking:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp oil, separated (vegetable, canola, or peanut)</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 small brown onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp whole black peppercorns (sub 2 tsp coarse cracked pepper)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Serving:</h3>
            <li>2 green onions/scallions, sliced (garnish)</li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine chick and marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high head. Remove chicksn from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned - about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken al lthe way through.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook for 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar, and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken, smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
            <li>If the sauce isn't thick enouch, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice.</li>
        </ol>
